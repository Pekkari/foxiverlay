Subject: [PATCH 08/14] softmmu/memory: enable automatic deallocation of memory
 regions

When the memory region has a different life-cycle from that of her parent,
could be automatically released, once has been unparent and once all of her
references have gone away, via the object's free callback.

However, currently, references to the memory region are held by its owner
without first incrementing the memory region object's reference count.
As a result, the automatic deallocation of the object, not taking into
account those references, results in use-after-free memory corruption.

This patch increases the reference count of an owned memory region object
on each memory_region_ref() and decreases it on each memory_region_unref().
